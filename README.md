# ConstructorWordGuess
Created a node application-Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.
User can open this app in the command line and it will prompt you to play game. It will randomly select a word from a 
pre-determined list of words and display the blank letter spaces of that word for the user. User has twelve guesses to guess
